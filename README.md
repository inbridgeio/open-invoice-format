## What is the Open Invoice Format

An open-source, JSON-based schema for invoices. This project is designed to offer a simple and reliable alternative to complex standards like **ZUGFeRD** and **XRechnung**. Built on [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org), it ensures easy validation and parsing across all programming languages.

## Why Another Invoice Standard?

Existing standards like ZUGFeRD and XRechnung are powerful but come with significant drawbacks:

### Key Drawbacks of ZUGFeRD and XRechnung:
- **Complexity:** Both standards include a wide range of optional and mandatory fields, just making them overly complicated and open for errors.
- **Overhead:** Parsing and validating these formats require specialized libraries and expertise.
- **Redundancy:** They often include calculated fields, such as totals and subtotals, which can introduce inconsistencies and errors. Also strict types are missing to parse it properly on all sides.
- **Flexibility Issues:** Limited customization options for non-standard use cases.

### How This Schema Addresses These Issues:
- **Minimalism:** Only the essential data needed for parsing and validation is included.
- **Fixed Structure:** Key fields like countries and currencies are strictly standardized for consistency.
- **No Redundant Fields:** Summations like total costs are deliberately omitted, as they should be calculated dynamically in the frontend or implementation-specific logic.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Designed for straightforward integration without unnecessary overhead.

## Key Features

- **Open Source:** Fully open for use and contributions.
- **Language-Agnostic:** JSON-based design ensures compatibility with all modern programming languages.
- **Easy to Validate:** Leverage JSON Schema for quick validation.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clean and intuitive design for rapid implementation.

## Schema details

### How to use inside a PDF:
To use the open invoice format like ZugFeRD inside a PDF. Your JSON should be attached as `inbridge-oif.json` to the PDF.
We recommend to use one of our [integration libraries](#integration-libraries) to make working with OIF as easy as pie!

For the full schema, check out our latest [schema.json](schema.json).
